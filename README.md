# Datasciencecoursera Taking this course has been very expoloratory. It is new for me but I am very optimistic and excited to learn all about the specialization especially machine learning. I signed up for this specialization since I have access to so much data that i need to make sense of almost all the time

I made this changes because it is critical for me to always recall the outstanding reasons for my actions
The second changes were purely for grammartical reasons
